[NOTICE]
Any Birdfont and TTF files currently contained in this folder and its subfolders whose names contain "test" are NOT the final product. They are sloppy temporary documents which are being used to test the functionality of the typeface before moving it into a properly configured document. Don't rename these files to "Hotoshi Quielic" or anything similar as it would be misleading.
